# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game


## What is this website about?

Rock Paper Scissors is a zero-sum game usually played by two people using their hands. In the game, two opponents randomly choose from three hand gestures: Rock, Paper, or Scissors. Each gesture wins, loses, or draws with equal probability. It's a game of pure luck, not skill.

## How this website is created

This project is a functional sample written entirely in Python. The game allows the user to play against the computer by choosing one of the three options:

- **0** for Rock
- **1** for Paper
- **2** for Scissors

The computer's choice is randomized, and the winner is determined based on the classic rules of the game.

## Features

### Header
- Displays the game title and instructions.

### Game Result
- Shows the outcome of each round (win, lose, or draw).

## Structure

The project consists of the following files:
- **index.html**: The main HTML file.
- **main.css**: The CSS file for styling.
- **main.js**: The JavaScript file for game logic.

## Validation

- **HTML Validation**: Ensure your HTML code is valid using online validators.
- **CSS Validation**: Validate your CSS code to maintain consistency.
- **JavaScript Testing**: Use browser developer tools to check for any errors.

## Deployment

Deploy your project to a web server or hosting service to make it accessible online.
